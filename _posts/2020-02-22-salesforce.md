## [What you get](#what-you-get)
Leads from **Salesforce** CRM can be assigned to TEC AI Sales Assistant directly within the Salesforce UI. AI Assistant will then own the lead and communicate to try and get the meeting. Assistant will also update the lead details putting notes for the emails being sent as well as status of the lead in salesforce. 

One **important** point to note, as soon as the AI Assistant receives a response from the lead and detects it to be a Hot or Responded the assistant assigns the lead back to the original owner.

For onboarding your AI Assistant on Salesforce please reach out to support@theeminenceco.com
