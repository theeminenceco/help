## [Schedule Sequence](#schedule-sequence)
`Schedule Sequence` helps you decide how you want the assistant to followup. i.e.  
- how many followups
- days between each followups

Assistant comes with two default schedules `Recommended` and `Recommended for Email CC`. 
You can clone from one of these schedules and create a new one, providing an appropriate name and description. 

Leads from different geographies would need different followups. for e.g. it may be OK to followup 7 times for leads in Americas but for Europe we recommend not more than 4 times. Custom schedule gives you the ability to pick the number of followups and the days between each appropriately, along with the messages to be sent on each followup.   

You may want to create a custom message for your first email. We recommend to use the tone based generated emails for the followup as they are short and to the point.  
The followup emails will continue to retain the first email to keep the context, having short emails for followups is recommended if you intend to write your own followup messages too.

To create or use an existing custom message you can select the `Message Type` as `Custom message` for that particular followup. Then select an existing message of `Create New` for the Message column.  
While creating or editing a message you can add more followups or reduce by deleting the followup rows. 

Please note that any change the existing schedule would take effect for the leads it is used for.

Schedule is accessible to other users in the org to use, they cannot edit it though. 

If you want to delete a specific schedule, you have to click on the delete icon which comes up on hover of the specific schedule in the schedule drop down list. System provided schedules cannot be deleted, so the delete icon will not come in front of them.
