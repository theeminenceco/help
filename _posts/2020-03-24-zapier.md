## [What you get](#what-you-get)
To connect a customers existing CRM (such as Salesforce, Hubspot, Pipedrive, Zoho or any of the 100s oF CRMs), we can do that using TEC's Zapier integration.

Zapier already has integrations with hundreds of CRMs. Its an integration hub. TEC also integrates with Zapier, allowing TEC to communicate with any other well known CRM in the world.

If a customers CRM is not well known, or is home grown, and does not have a integration with Zapier, then we have APIs that we have exposed so they can call those APIs and connect to TEC via APIs.

The Zapier TEC Integration is still private and is not yet on the Zapier public marketplace. So you can access it via this [private link](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/73649/157f0098ab326f339526b19ff7de5526/)
