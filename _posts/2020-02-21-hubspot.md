## [What you get](#what-you-get)
TEC AI Sales Assistant is created as a user in **HubSpot CRM**.
Contacts/Leads from HubSpot CRM can be assigned to TEC AI Sales Assistant directly within HubSpot CRM. AI Assistant will then own the lead, communicate and nurture to try and get the meeting. Assistant will update the communication details (email, task) in HubSpot for each contact Assistant is nurturing.

One important point to note, after AI Assistant is done with her job, she will assign the lead back to the original owner.

## [Setup Details](#setup-details)

`Important Note` : HubSpot Admin level access is required to create a new user for Assistant in HubSpot. Org Admin access on TEC is required to sync the Assistant User from HubSpot. 

If not already authorized yet then Authorize from HubSpot [Marketplace] by clicking this link [authorise](https://solution.theeminenceco.com/hubspot-authorize){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  
If you are already connected to Hubspot via some other Assistant in TEC then you are already authorized.  

You can confirm or check your setup connectivity from “Settings”->”CRM Details”. Meaning of the status on the CRM Details page is explained below. 

Once Authorization is complete, follow below steps for further configuration.

**1.** If not yet signed up or invited and created an Assistant in TEC. Please refer [Signup](../../getting-started/signup/). If user is already created then complete the onboarding of the user by creating the [Assistant](../../getting-started/create-your-assistant/)

**2.**  Invite user in HubSpot for your Assistant’s email id. You will have to be Hubspot Admin for this. You can get the Assistant email id from the Assistant page. Below screenshot show how to copy Assistant's email id.  
![Assistant's email](../../images/assistant-email.png)
HubSpot sends an invitation email to the newly created Assistant user. This email is received by the Assistant and is forwarded to the user(Assistant’s boss).  

User is expected to open this email and accept the invitation by clicking the link in the invitation email and join HubSpot on Assistant’s behalf.  

While clicking this link make sure you have logged out of Hubspot from your earlier session, so that you are taken to the login page of Hubspot. Where you would have to put the newly invited user’s email (Assistant’s email) and set a password.

**3.** Go to **"Settings"->"CRM Details"** in TEC. By clicking he Refresh button lets verify if the Assistant user is created in HubSpot. Against each Assistant you will see the CRM Integration Status. ![CRM Integration Status](../../images/crm-integration-status.png)

## Meaning of CRM Integration Status:  
**ASSISTANT_EXISTS_AS_USER_IN_CRM** : You are all set. Go ahead and assign the contact from HubSpot to the Assistant user in HubSpot. That contact should be seen as lead in TEC in few seconds. Assistant should also update the note for the contact that she is going to work on it.  
**ALL_WORKING_WELL** : All set, it is working well for you. You have already assigned contact in HubSpot to the Assistant and she is working on it too.  
**ASSISTANT_DOES_NOT_EXISTS_AS_USER_IN_CRM** : Go back to step 2 above. If still facing issues drop an email to support@theeminenceco.com.  
**ASSISTANT_NOT_YET_CREATED** : Follow Step 1 onwards.   

**4.** In HubSpot, disable email notifications for the Assistant user from Settings. This is to avoid unnecessary emails being sent to the Assistant. 
![disable email notifications](../../images/disable-email-notifications.png)

**5.** Verify in TEC that your Assistant has a Default Context. It is available on Edit Assistant page. Default context is used by the Assistant to write an email. You can check how the context is used by Assistant when writing an email. Just try to add a new lead from TEC. Other default values can be filled too. 
![Default Context](../../images/assistant-defaults.png)

**6.** Sync the schedules from TEC to Hubspot. If you intend to provide the Schedule while the contact/lead is assigned to the Assistant in Hubspot, then the schedules from TEC has to be synced in Hubspot. These schedule will be available in the field `TEC Schedule`. You can select the schedule you want while assigning the lead to the Assistant.

If you do not provide any schedule then the assistant default schedule will be picked. 

**7.** You are all set, assign a contact/lead in HubSpot to the Assistant user and verify that you see that lead in TEC in the "Leads" page. As well check that Assistant would have left a note in the Contact Activity in Hubspot.
![Assign to Assistant](../../images/assign-to-assistant.png)

**8.**  If you intend to pass context to the lead from HubSpot then use the custom field named "Context" for Contacts in HubSpot. With this, when you assign the contact/lead to Assistant user and if there is any context provided for this contact/lead then Assistant will use that else it will use the default context at the Assistant level in TEC. Note that Assistant will update back a custom field named "Lead Connection Status" in HubSpot.

<a name="how-it-works"/>
## [How it works](#how-it-works)
- After the contact in Hubspot is assigned to the Assistant user in Hubspot, Assistant will own it for nurturing. Assistant will use the default Schedule and Context as configured in TEC.
- Assistant will leave a note of confirmation like below image for the assigned contact.
![Confirmation Note from Assistant](../../images/hubspot-confirmation-note.png)
- All the emails that Assistant sends or receives are logged in Hubspot too. Like in below image. 
![Logged Email by Assistant](../../images/hubspot-email.png)
- After Assistant is done with her work, the contact is assigned back to the previous Contact owner. For example, if there is a response from the lead, then Assistant will stop further emails and assign it back to the previous owner. 

**Can I provide the context from Hubspot while assigning the contact to the assistant?**  
Yes. TEC adds a `Context` field to the Hubspot Contact and you can provide the value for it from Hubspot. If a value is provided then Assistant uses that instead of the default Context.  
**Can I see the TEC Lead status in Hubspot?**  
Yes. TEC adds a field `Lead Connection Status` to the Hubspot Contact and Assistant will keep it updated as the lead turn from Cold to Warm to Hot. You can add this field to your view or filter on it as required.

## Re-assignment of Hubspot Contact
Re-assignment of a contact from HubSpot would not be picked by the Assistant for processing. This is to avoid accidental re-assignments, when user does multiple select and assign to the Assistant in Hubspot.  
In such a scenario, Assistant would leave a note and assign the contact back to the previous owner.

If the user still wants to assign the contact to the Assistant, then user can delete the value from the field `Lead Connection Status` for that contact, and then assign it back to the Assistant.
