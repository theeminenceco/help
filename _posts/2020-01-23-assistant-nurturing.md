## [Nurturing Approach](#nurturing-approach)
How the assistant approaches the Lead Nurturing?  
Some fine points to note what the Assistant does for proper Nurturing.  
- Assistant will try and `optimize the time to send the emails` based on the time the email is typically read by the lead.
- Assistant will `not send the email when the lead is Out of Office`. Assistant can read and understand the Out of office emails and changes the next email send time appropriately to avoid sending any emails when the lead is Out of office
- Assistant will write `small emails and add one of the success stories`, testimonials, etc from the Nurturing Table in the email as *PS:* section
- Assistant can put the Cold/Warm and Processed leads on `Long Term Nurturing`. The schedule to use for this Long Term Nurturing is configurable via Preferences.
