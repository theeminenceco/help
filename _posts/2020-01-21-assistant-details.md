Assistant has the responsibility of communicating with the lead with an intent of getting a meeting. Assistant becomes a virtual team member in your team. 

One important behavior of the assistant is to stop sending more emails on receiving a response from the lead.

Assistant has a default recommended schedule of 7 follow-ups with increasing duration between the follow-ups. User has an option to use custom schedule and change the default schedule too.

Assistant optimizes the email send time for individual lead so that the chances of lead reading the email increases. This is `Send Time Optimization`.

## [Assistant Profile](#assistant-profile)
Name, Avatar, Email, Phone Number and Signature represents the Assistant identity. 

Leads see Name, Email, Phone Number and Signature of the Assistant and these can be edited as appropriate. Phone number is also used to notify you of the WARM and HOT leads on WhatsApp.

## [Assign Assistant to User](#assistant-assign)  
Assistant being specific to an industry and offering can be used by multiple users in your organization.  

As an org admin, after a user is invited in TEC, you can assign an existing assistant to that user. This user would be able to use the assistant and need not create a new one unless required.  

This helps make sure that the knowledge and expertise of the assistant is maintained and used by multiple users.  

Each user would see his/her own leads only, unless user is an org admin.  

## [Assistant Default](#assistant-defaults)
Assistant has many defaults which are self explanatory. Some of the important ones are mentioned below:

- `Brochure URL` Assistant will embed this URL in the email when responding to requests for Brochure
- `More Context` and `More Information` are the defaults to be used when not provided while adding the leads
- `Shared Calendar URL` If the value for this is provided while Edit Assistant then Assistant will add it in the signature with `Book a Meeting` link. One can create a shared calendar using some service like [Calendly](https://calendly.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  
- `Lead at Risk Reminder` Assistant will remind you after the provided days for 5 times if you forget to reach out to responded leads.
- `Default Schedule` Assistant uses this schedule by default for the added leads. While you can provide the schedule when adding leads from the TEC UI. Providing the schedule when adding leads from CRM or by copying Assistant in the email sent by you to your lead is not possible, so in these scenarios the default schedule is used by the assistant. Value of default schedule can be changed by going to Assistant->Edit Assistant.
- `Default EmailCC Schedule` is used by the assistant when assistant is copied in the email by the user with the lead. For EmailCC schedule, Assistant will start the with second message in the sequence. Your email where you Cc'ed/Copied the assistant is considered as the first email.

## [Multiple Assistants](#multiple-assistants)
You can create multiple assistants for yourself. Assistants cannot be shared or assigned to other users in the Org. 

We recommend to have `geography and vertical specific` assistants. So that the assistant is trained for nurturing the leads of that vertical with specific nurturing material.
