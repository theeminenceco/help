## Message Library
Message Library provides you some Out of the box message templates, with the intent to get you started easily.
We will continue to add more groups and more messages in each group. 
![Message Library Group](../../images/message-library.png)
You can click on any of the groups to see the out of the box messages in that group.

## How to Use 
You will have to click view icon of the message which you want to use. Put the text in the `place holder marked by [ ]` of that message and save it.

This will be saved as a Custom Message and you will be able to see it in your Custom Message and use it in your Schedule.
