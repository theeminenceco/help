## [Custom Messages](#custom-messages)
Custom Message give you the ability to write your own message and make it part of a schedule, so that Assistant can use that instead of generating or writing.  
We recommend to let the Assistant write or generate the followup messages at-least, if not the first message. As Assistant will write different message for each lead.

There are some out of the box custom messages (e.g. `post proposal msg`) which you can use but not change. One can edit only those custom messages which are created by him/her. If you want to change something from a message which cannot be edited by you, then clone that message and create your own.

## Personalization 
Custom message and subject can be personalized by using parameters. Available parameters are: 
- Lead First Name
- LeAd Last Name
- Lead Designation
- Lead Phone Number
- Lead Company
- Lead Industry
- Organisation Name
- Organisation Website
- Assistant Name

One e.g. of the Personalization is, using Assistant name in the Subject or message of a Custom Message which is used by across the Org my multiple users. 

## Image in Email
While text emails give a personal human like touch to the emails, at times you may want to include an image in the email sent by the assistant. You can do so.  
While creating or editing the custom message, click on the image icon in the tool bar, select your image and the image will be inserted at the place of your cursor. 

We recommend to keep the image size small (like less than 200 KB). As well, the dimensions of the image to not more than 700X400, so that the image when visible to the lead does not take the whole screen.
